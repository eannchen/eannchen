### Hi there 🙋🏻, I'm Ian

**Thanks for stopping by my GitHub profile—it’s great to connect!**

My early career was focused on learning the latest tools to build products. With more experience, I've come to realize the lasting value of strong fundamentals and have since shifted my focus to mastering them.

Here are a few things about me:
- 💼 My primary tools are **Go** and **Docker**.
  - Check my [LinkedIn profile](https://linkedin.com/in/eannchen/) for more on my work experience.
- 🌱 I’m sharpening my **problem-solving** and **system design** skills.
  - My [public Notion notes](https://eannc.cc) document my learning journey.
  - You can also see my progress and solutions on my [LeetCode profile](https://leetcode.com/eannchen/).
- 🛠️ I’m the creator of **[LeetSolv](https://github.com/eannchen/leetsolv)** — an open-source CLI tool for **DSA problem revision**, powered by **a custom SM-2 algorithm** to help you master algorithms through **deliberate practice**.
  - Read the [project story](https://github.com/eannchen/leetsolv/blob/main/document/MOTIVATION.md) to learn why I built it.
